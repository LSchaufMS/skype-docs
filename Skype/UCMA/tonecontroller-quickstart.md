# ToneController (QuickStart)


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015



**Sample name**: ToneController

**Sample location**: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 5.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\AudioVideoCall\\ToneController

## Description

The application places an audio/video call to the designated target, after initializing platform and endpoints. After the call is connected, the application waits for the **AudioVideoFlow** to become active (when the value of its **State** property is **Active**), and then attaches a **ToneController** and registers a handler for an event that is raised when a DTMF tones or Fax tones are received. For each tone that is received, the application replies by sending the same tone back to the remote endpoint. Zero and a fax tone will shut down the platform and close the demo.
